## FAQ

  

#### How do I decrypt?

  A feature with MonkeCipher is that it is **discreetly undecryptable** and requires a lot of brainpower to decrypt. It is impossible to brute force MonkeCipher via a computer but easy for a human. **We do not recommend using key based decryption**, it should only be used for developement.

  

#### Is it secure?

This cipher was developed after years of work at Foothill's Cybersecurity Labs and has been hailed as a performant alterative to AES. 
We have done the math [in our paper](https://github.com/orcanshul/monke-cipher/blob/main/PAPER.md) and have confirmed the security of MonkeCipher.
